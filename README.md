This is my first project in IIoT with MQTT protocol and Mongodb charts...
it's not finished but all Pis-of-Code working fine like:
connecting Backend Server NodeJS with Mongodb NoSQL database with HTML as HMI via MQTT protocol to monitor Real-Time data and sending an alarms to Telegram app.
so you can see a short videos for all that stuff here:
